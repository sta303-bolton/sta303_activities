## Instructions

This is a revision task based on the Week 1 Team Up! activity. There are no bonus points for completing the task asynchronously, but I hope it might be a useful revision tool for you.

There are hints for some questions. In these cases the final hint is complete correct code.

You can clear your answers and start again with the 'Start Over' button at the bottom of the menu. (I doubt this is well optimised for mobile, so if you can't see it, use a larger screen.)

Question 1 to 6 refer to the TV show data discussed in the next tab. Question 7, 8 and 9 are self-contained.

## The data

### Golden age of TV?
Let's look at some data from a [2018 article in the Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/11/24/tvs-golden-age-is-real).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/economist-tv-golden-age.png")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(lubridate) # to make it easy to work with dates

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheEconomist/graphic-detail-data/master/data/2018-11-24_tv-ratings/IMDb_Economist_tv_ratings.csv"

tv_data <- read_csv(url)

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
head(tv_data, n = 10)

glimpse(tv_data)
```

Each row (i.e., observation) is a season of TV show.

Suppose we are interested in investigating the association between when an season was released (`decade`, the decade that the TV show was released, or `date`, the actual date) and `av_rating` (average rating per season).

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Fix up the data a bit (we'll talk about data wrangling)
tv_data_edit <- tv_data %>% 
  mutate(decade = lubridate::floor_date(ymd(date), years(10))) %>% 
  mutate(decade = as.character(format(decade,"%Y"))) %>% 
  group_by(decade)
```

## Question 1 

### Assumptions

Carefully consider the `head` and `glimpse` of the data provided in the data section and the plot below.

```{r, scatterplot}
tv_data_edit %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = av_rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x") +
  labs(title = "Average rating of TV seasons by date aired", subtitle = "Line of best fit shown in blue", y = "Average rating of season", x= "Date", caption = "Source: The Economist")

```

Suppose you wish to use fit a model to predict average season rating (`av_rating`) from `date` alone. Using just the information you have so far, which ONE of the following comments is most appropriate?

**
A. Linear regression seems appropriate.  
B. Linear regression does not seem appropriate due to the independence assumption being violated.  
C. Linear regression does not seem appropriate due to the equality of variance assumption being violated.  
D. Linear regression does not seem appropriate due to the linearity assumption being violated.
**

Note: In the following questions we will assume we can proceed with linear regression. This may or may not be _correct_. I.e. it is not a hint to the answer to this question.

```{r assumptions, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B", correct = TRUE),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D"),
         message = "This one is a little tricky because it requires you to think carefully about the structure of the data. You'll notice from the summaries in the 'The data' tab (or if you just think about how TV shows work) that each season is a season OF A TV SHOW. Do you except the quality and ratings of seasons of the same TV show to be independent? I don't! That is why I think our independence assumption is probably violated here. One of the topics we'll cover in the course will give us more tools for dealing with repeated measure situations like this."
)
```


## Question 2

### t-test

Suppose you talk to a TV critic and they suggest that in industry there is a common belief that the average 'average' rating for TV shows in the 2010s was 8.1. (Note the careful language, we are working with data aggregated at the season level.)

Restrict the data to just the seasons from 2010. (If you don't know how to do this, there is a hint). Run a one sample t-test to test the claim from the TV critic. 

```{r onetest, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r onetest-hint-1}
# You can get just the 2010 data with this code
just2010 <- filter(tv_data_edit, decade == "2010")
```

```{r onetest-hint-2}
# What is your null hypothesis here? Rember that you use mu = hypothesised value (insert valeu) to represent your hypothesised value
```

```{r onetest-solution}
just2010 <- filter(tv_data_edit, decade == "2010")
t.test(tv_data_edit$av_rating, mu = 8.1)
```

```{r include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
just2010 <- filter(tv_data_edit, decade == "2010")
t.test(tv_data_edit$av_rating, mu = 8.1)
```

Which of the following is the best conclusion based on the result of your t-test?

**
A. We have no evidence against the claim that the average, average rating is 8.1.  
B. We have some evidence against the claim that that the average, average rating is 8.1.  
C. We have very strong evidence against the claim that the average, average rating is 8.1.  
D. The `t.test` functions produces an error due to a violation of Normality assumption.
**

```{r onetest_ans, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B",),
         answer("C",  correct = TRUE),
         answer("D"),
         message = "Our p-value is large so we have no evidence against our null hypothesis, which is the claim that the average (average) season rating is 8.1."
)
```


## Question 3

### Toy data

Let's take a moment to do something very simple. I have pulled five observations from each decade to plot.

```{r simpleplot, out.width=600}
set.seed(13)

# A very simple example
simple <- tv_data_edit %>% 
  sample_n(5) %>% 
  mutate(mean = mean(av_rating))

p <- simple %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = decade, y = av_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
p
```

### How do we make sense of this with linear regression?

Let's start by fitting a line to each group separately. (Aside: if you interpreted each of these as a one sample t-test, you'd be testing $H_0: \mu 

```{r, echo=TRUE}

sep_mod <- c(
  lm(av_rating~1, filter(simple, decade == 1990))$coef,
  lm(av_rating~1, filter(simple, decade == 2000))$coef,
  lm(av_rating~1, filter(simple, decade == 2010))$coef
  )

names(sep_mod) <- c("xbar1990", "xbar2000", "xbar2010")

sep_mod

```

Hopefully you agree that the intercept of each of these 'intercept only' models are the means of each group.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean, ymax = mean), colour = "#612464") +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean,2), y = mean), nudge_x = 0.3, nudge_y = 0.05)

```

Now suppose I claim that we can describe all 15 points with this equation:

$$y_i = d_{1}\bar{x}_{1990} + d_{2}\bar{x}_{2000} + d_{3}\bar{x}_{2010} + \epsilon_i$$

Where $\epsilon_i \sim \text{N}(0, \sigma)$.

Which ONE of the following would have to be true for this to be true?

**
A. $d_1$ would be a column of FIFTEEN 1s and then $d_2$ and $d_3$ would be columns of 0s and 1s, and take the value 1 when the observation is from 2000 and 2010 respectively.  
B. There are infinite possible combinations of three $d$ vectors for which this would be true, so as long as it is any one of those, this will be true.  
C. Each $d$ would have to be a vector of FIVE 0s and 1s, and take the value 1 when the observation is the decade indicated by the $\mu_{year}$ it is multiplied by.  
D. Each $d$ would have to be a vector of FIFTEEN 0s and 1s, and take the value 1 when the observation is that decade.
**

```{r whatd, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B"),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D", correct = TRUE),
         message = "The 0s and 1s for our d vectors act as 'on' and 'off' switches for the group means. We need an element per observation, hence the length of 15, and in this particular set up, where each d is associated with a decade mean, there would be no 'intercept' style columns of all ones."
)
```


## Question 4

### Equations

Which ONE of these equations is equivalent to $y_i = d_{1}\bar{x}_{1990} +d_{2}\bar{x}_{2000} + d_{3}\bar{x}_{2010} +\epsilon_i$?

A. $y_i = \bar{x}_{1990} + d_{2}(\bar{x}_{2000}-\bar{x}_{1990}) + d_{3}(\ \bar{x}_{2010}-\bar{x}_{1990}) +\epsilon_i$  
B. $y_i = \bar{x}_{1990} + d_{2}(\bar{x}_{2000}-\bar{x}_{1990}-\bar{x}_{2010}) + d_{3}(\bar{x}_{2010}-\bar{x}_{1990}-\bar{x}_{2000})+\epsilon_i$  
C. $y_i = (\bar{x}_{1990} +\bar{x}_{2000} + \bar{x}_{2010})*(-d_{1} - d_{2} - d_{3})$  
D. $y_i =d_{1}(\bar{x}_{1990}- \bar{x}_{2010}) + d_{2}( \bar{x}_{2000}- \bar{x}_{1990}) + d_{3}( \bar{x}_{2010}- \bar{x}_{1990}) +\epsilon_i$

```{r dummies, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A", correct = TRUE),
         answer("B"),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D"),
         message = "This can be done with just plain algebra, or you might like to think about the image, and that you can get to each other group mean by starting at the first groups mean and moving up or down the distance between the two groups. The red lines in the picture represent the first and second bracketed components, respectively "
)
```

You may (or may not) find this visualization helpful to your thinking.

```{r out.width=500}

# Add mean of group one, blue line 
p +
  geom_hline(yintercept = lm(av_rating~1, filter(simple, decade == 1990))$coef, color = "blue") +
# Add means of other groups in black  
  geom_segment(x = 1.7, xend = 2.3, y = sep_mod[2], yend = sep_mod[2]) +
  geom_segment(x = 2.7, xend = 3.3, y = sep_mod[3], yend = sep_mod[3]) +
# Beta 1 and Beta 2 are slopes of these red lines
  geom_segment(x = 2, xend = 2, y = sep_mod[1], yend = sep_mod[2], col = "red") +
  geom_segment(x = 3, xend = 3, y = sep_mod[1], yend = sep_mod[3], col = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean,3), y = mean), nudge_x = 0.3, nudge_y = 0.05)
```

## Question 5

### ANOVA assumption rule of thumb

**Note**: there are specific tests for equality of variances, but for the purposes of this course we will just consider a rule of thumb from Dean and Voss (*Design and Analysis of Experiments*, 1999, page 112): if the ratio of the largest within-in group variance estimate to the smallest within-group variance estimate does not exceed 3,  $s^2_{max}/s^2_{min}<3$ , the assumption is probably satisfied. 

The below code produces a summary of the `tv_data_edit` tibble. You can ignore the '.groups = "keep"' part. Even if you are unfamiliar with the over syntax, you should be able to figure out what a, b, c, d and e are from your previous knowledge of R. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tv_data_edit %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  summarise(a = mean(av_rating), b = var(av_rating), c = sd(av_rating), d = var(av_rating)^2, e = max(av_rating), .groups = "keep")
```

```{r eqvar, exercise = TRUE}
# You can use this area as a calculator if you wish

```

Which of the following is true based on this table?

**
A. The equality of variances assumption appears to be satisfied, therefore ANOVA is definitely appropriate.   
B. The equality of variances assumption appears to be satisfied, but we can't proceed with ANOVA without checking the other assumptions.  
C.  The equality of variances assumption appears to be seriously violated, therefore ANOVA is not appropriate.  
D. Not enough information to make a claim about the equality of variances assumption.
**

```{r eqvar-ans, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B", correct = TRUE),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D"),
         message = "Need to look at column b for this as it shows the variances. The max is 0.686 and the min is 0.361 and 0.686/0.361 < 3 so that equality of variances assumption appears fine BUT there are other assumptions for ANOVA, so we would need to think about if they were appropriatelt satisfies before proceeding."
)
```

## Question 6


### One-way ANOVA as regression

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(lm(av_rating ~ decade, data = tv_data_edit))

summary(aov(av_rating ~ decade, data = tv_data_edit))
```

Assume the assumptions for ANOVA are valid (this may not be true). Which ONE of the following is the best conclusion?

**
A. We have very strong evidence (p-value < 2e-16) against the hypothesis that the mean season average ratings are the same in each decade.  
B. We have very strong evidence (p-value = 5.788e-08) against the hypothesis that the mean season average ratings are the same in each decade.  
C. We have very very strong evidence (p-value = 5.788e-08) that at least one of the mean season average ratings is different from the others.   
D. We have very strong evidence (p-value < 2e-16) that at least one of the mean season average ratings is different from the others.
**

```{r anova-conc, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B", correct = TRUE),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D"),
         message = "The correct p-value to interpret is 5.788e-08. You'll see it on the bottom line of the lm output (the one that starts with F-statistic, which is our test statistics for ANOVA. It is a very small number (0.00000005788), and the smaller the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST our null hypothesis. Being very careful with our language here, we never want to say evidence FOR the alternative."
)
```

## Question 7

### Linearity

Which ONE of these models is NOT linear?

A. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_3^2$  
B. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2X_3$  
C. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + X_3^{\beta_2}$  
D. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \beta_3cos(X_3)$  

```{r linear, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B"),
         answer("C", correct = TRUE),
         answer("D"),
         message = "In C, there is a beta in an exponent, which makes this non-linear, because it is not linear in the parameters."
)
```

## Question 8

### LaTeX

LaTeX is a document preparation system that allows us to type set mathematical symbols well. In R Markdown, which we will use for assessments in this course (more on that next week for those who are unfamiliar), we can use LaTeX syntax to write equations and mathematical symbols. Single dollar sign pairs \$ create inline expressions and double dollar sign pairs (\$\$) will show the express in display mode.

Inline: $\pi^2$

Display: $$\pi^2$$

- Greek letters can be displayed with a back slash before their name, e.g., `$\eta$` -> $\eta$.
- Superscripts: `$a^b$` -> $a^b$, or `$a^{2b}$` -> $a^{2b}$.
- Subscripts: `$a_b$` -> $a_b$, or `$a_{2b}$` -> $a_{2b}$.

Note: `$a_bi$` -> $a_bi$

Which of the following lines of LaTeX would create the equation below (if correctly put in dollar signs \$)? 

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \epsilon_i$$

A. `yi = \beta0 + \beta1x{1i} + \epsilon i`  
B. `y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1i + \epsilon_i`  
C. `y_i = \b_0 + \b_0\ex_1i + \error_i`  
D. `y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \epsilon_i`  

```{r latex, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B"),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D", correct = TRUE),
         message = "A is wrong because it is missing the underscores for subscripts. B is wrong because the 1i should be in curly brackets, i.e., {1i} otherwise the i won't be included in the subscript. C is wrong because \\error isn't the command for epsilon, nor is \\ex for x or \\b for beta, and it has the same subscript problem as B."
)
```

## Question 9

### Course logistics

One of the important administrative [Forms](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/204826/pages/forms) for this course has an emoji hiding in it. Check each of the forms and select which ONE of the following emoji it is.

**
A. 🚯   
B. 🔤  
C. 🚝  
D. 🕧  
**

Note: These are all examples of unpopular (i.e. not commonly used) emoji based on http://emojitracker.com/. Photosensitivity warning for flashing as the site updates real-time.

```{r formemoji, include=TRUE}
question("What is the correct answer?",
         answer("A"),
         answer("B", correct = TRUE),
         answer("C"),
         answer("D"),
         message = "You'll just have to go open the forms to check."
)
```
