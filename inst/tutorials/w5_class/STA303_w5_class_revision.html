<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This is a revision task based on the Week 5 Team Up! activity. There are no bonus points for completing the task asynchronously, but I hope it might be a useful revision tool for you.</p>
<p>There are hints for some questions. In these cases the final hint is complete correct code.</p>
<p>You can clear your answers and start again with the ‘Start Over’ button at the bottom of the menu. (I doubt this is well optimized for mobile, so if you can’t see it, use a larger screen.)</p>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a dataset (<code>school1</code>) with 1000 students randomly sampled from the list of all students in Grade 8 in the Netherlands. Your data set has the following variables:</p>

<p>There is a very convenient plotting function from the <code>lattice</code> package that makes it easy to visualize random effects. Note that we have a point estimate for each random effect AND a confidence interval around it. When we calculate a fitted value with our model, the point estimate of the random effect is added on for each student based on their school.
